## Python Variables

Variables are named references to **Objects**.

```python
>>> x = 4
>>> x
4
```
We create variables by using the assignment operator `=` . Variables do not store any value, but point to where the value is created in the computers memory.

When we equate two variables we are  referencing the variables to the same value.

Python variables can store values from any data type. Since Python is dynamic in nature we do not have to specify what type of data we are storing.

```python

>>> x = 12
>>> x
12
>>> x = "Hello"
>>> x
Hello
>>> pie = 3.1423
>>> pie
3.1423
```
