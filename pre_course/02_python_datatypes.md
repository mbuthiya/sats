### Datatypes

Python has two main categories of data types

### 1. Scalar Data Types

These are data types that can only hold one single value at a time .

1. `int` hold whole numbered integers.
2. `floats` hold integers with decimal points.
3. `None` this represents a **null** or non-existent value.
4. `bool` these represent boolean statements and have only 2 possible values `True` or `False`


### 2. Collections
Like the name suggests these data types store multiple values.

1. `str` - This data type is used to represent string values
2. `byte` - This data type is used to represent byte strings.

	Byte strings are similar to strings but have been changed so that they can be stored on the hard drive we will not cover much on them here.
3. `list`- lists are are a way to store some group of related data
4. `dict` - These allow us to create dictionaries which is data that is stored in key value pairs

We will consider these much more in depth as we go on with the course
