A python module is a single executable python file. It has a `.py` extension.

Let us create this on our desktops.Create a folder and name it _MS-Python-Pre-work_.
Create a new file and name it `module_test.py`. Open atom and type in the following

```python
greeting = "Hello"
school = "Moringa"

print(greeting + ", "+school+"!")
```

To execute this code we have just written we. Open the console to where the file we created is located and run the following command

```bash
$ python3.6 module_test.py
Hello, Moringa!

```
We type in `python3.6` then the name of the file `module_test.py`. The code is immediately executed and we get our output as `Hello, Moringa!`

A python program is a collection of modules that are linked to perform a particular function
