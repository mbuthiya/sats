Python is a General-purpose programming language. It is used in various fields such as __mathematics, agriculture, electronics ,mechanics__

It is a **Strongly Typed** language, in that every _object_ in python has a definite type associated with it.

It is also **Dynamically Typed**, meaning no type checking is done prior to running Python code.

Python is an **Interpreted Language**. Code _compilation_ and _execution_ is done at the same time.



### Why Python?

Python is 
1. **Powerful** - It is a  general-purpose language that is used in a wide variety of career fields.
2. **Dynamic** - It can build anything from simple scripts to very large and dynamic applications.
3. **Open Source** - so it is freely available for developers to contribute to.
4. **Popular** with a large community who keep on updating,supporting and maintaining the code base.
5. **Large** - Due to it being general purpose it comes with a large and extensive standard library and also has a large library for third party modules
